1
00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:05,981
Ravana was the evil king of Lanka

2
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:10,986
and he just stole Sita.

3
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:13,989
He was an incredibly learned man.  From what I understand, Ravana was...

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:16,992
Actually the only bad thing he seems to have done...

5
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:19,528
...is capture Sita.

6
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:22,998
Which is kind of interesting because everything else about him seems to be, like

7
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:25,000
he was this really learned guy,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,001
he knows all these weapons

9
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,170
he prays to the right Gods...

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,273
so all this stuff! He's like this Good King.

11
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:35,010
Except that, over time, we've been led to believe he's this complete...

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,013
that he's like Mogambo.

13
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:41,016
That's right, he lived on an island also!

14
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:45,020
He was a devoted Shiva-bhakta.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,022
and he plays -
-all these instruments...

16
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:50,025
Veena with his intestines.

17
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:52,027
With his intestines?

18
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:54,029
Yeah, for Shiva.

19
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:58,500
There's this whole thing about how devoted a fan he was
