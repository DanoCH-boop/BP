1
00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:05,981
Ravana was the evil king of Lanka

2
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:10,986
and he just stole Sita.

3
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:13,989
He was an incredibly learned man.  From what I understand, Ravana was...

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:16,992
Actually the only bad thing he seems to have done...

5
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:19,528
...is capture Sita.

6
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:22,998
Which is kind of interesting because everything else about him seems to be, like

7
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:25,000
he was this really learned guy,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,001
he knows all these weapons

9
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,170
he prays to the right Gods...

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,273
so all this stuff! He's like this Good King.

11
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:35,010
Except that, over time, we've been led to believe he's this complete...

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,013
that he's like Mogambo.

13
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:41,016
That's right, he lived on an island also!

14
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:45,020
He was a devoted Shiva-bhakta.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,022
and he plays -
-all these instruments...

16
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:50,025
Veena with his intestines.

17
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:52,027
With his intestines?

18
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:54,029
Yeah, for Shiva.

19
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:58,500
There's this whole thing about how devoted a fan he was

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,438
and he's asking Lord Shiva for some wish

21
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:08,143
and, you know, he is basically playing Veena with his intestines.

22
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:10,979
It's hard to fell someone like that in battle, because

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,482
what is pain to a man who plays Veena on his intestines?

24
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:15,084
Nothing much.

25
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,986
What I'm really impressed with is he was the king of Sri Lanka.

26
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:20,989
No, he was the king of Lanka.

27
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:23,992
It was Lanka. It's called Ceylon. It's the same country I think.

28
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:25,994
Well the point is that's what we think.

29
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:26,995
They built the bridge.

30
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:30,999
The bridge still exists, so NASA images say.

31
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:36,004
Really? NASA? It must be true then!

32
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:39,007
Maybe they saw it when they were on the moon!

33
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:42,544
Isn't the Suruphanaka story - Suruphanaka right?

34
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:45,013
Surphanaka.

35
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,015
I'm messing up her name. God, they're gonna be after me

36
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,351
Surphanaka is the one with the really ugly nose.

37
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,520
Surphanaka. But she was Ravana's sister.

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,025
Ravana! Rama has slaughtered your Rakshasas in the forest. You must take revenge!

39
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:02,364
Don't do it, Master. Rama is powerful.

40
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:06,926
Sister, do not bother me with your petty concerns.

41
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,976
Dear Brother Ravana, have you seen Rama's wife Sita?

42
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:17,980
She is the most beautiful woman in the world.

43
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,550
Her skin is fair like the lotus blossom.

44
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,419
Her eyes are like lotus pools.

45
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,390
Her hands are like, um, lotuses.

46
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,952
Her breasts like big, round, firm, juicy...

47
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,997
Lotuses!

48
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:37,625
Mmmm, ahhhh...

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,805
Make Sita your wife, Ravana. Steal her from Rama!

50
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:46,008
Don't do it, Master!

51
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:51,469
I'll hear no arguments from you, Mareecha. You must help me at once.

52
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:57,653
Transform yourself into a beautful golden deer to distract Rama.

53
00:02:57,653 --> 00:03:03,025
While Sita is unguarded, I'll grab her!

54
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:09,191
Sita WILL be mine! Hahahahahaaa!

55
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,979
What a beautiful golden deer!

56
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,982
Oh Rama, won't you capture it for me?

57
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:29,985
I don't know, Sita. It could be a trick!

58
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:32,487
Oh Rama, pleeeaaase?

59
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:37,993
All right, Sita. You ask for so little and give me so much.

60
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:42,998
But promise you won't leave the hut while I'm gone. The forest is dangerous.

61
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:47,002
I promise! Oh Rama, I love you!

62
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:49,971
I love you, Sita.
