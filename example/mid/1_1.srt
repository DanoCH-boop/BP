1
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,815
They ought to make the day the time
changes the first day of summer.

2
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,155
What?

3
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:21,416
Well, it's eight o'clock
and it's still light.

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,262
A lot of good
the extra daylight does us.

5
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:26,020
Now we've still got
a three-hour drive back.

6
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,030
We're not going to be home
until after midnight.

7
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,792
Well, if it really bugged you,
Johnny, you wouldn't do it.

8
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,681
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

9
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,858
You know, I figure we're either
gonna have to move mother out here,

10
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,495
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

11
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,588
She can't make
a trip like this.

12
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:42,848
I don't know that she can't.

13
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,909
- Is there any candy left?
- No.

14
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:49,671
Look at this thing.
"We still remember. "

15
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:52,267
I don't. You know,
I don't even remember what the man I

16
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,067
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

17
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:59,173
5 minutes to put the wreath on the grave
and 6 hours to drive back and forth.

18
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,476
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles into the count

19
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,569
and she stays at home.

20
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,536
Well, we're here, John, all right?

21
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,750
Radio: Testing... back on...
Ah, ladies and... We're coming back

22
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:18,262
on the air after an interruption
due to technical problem...

23
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:33,792
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

24
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,136
Which row is it in?

25
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,447
There's no one around.

26
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,335
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

27
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:04,265
Oh, look, I already lost
an hour's sleep in the time change.

28
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,405
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

29
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,122
There it is.

30
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,707
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

31
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,097
Each year we spend
good money on these things.

32
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,777
We come out here, and the
one from last year is gone.

33
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,744
Well, the flowers die,

34
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,549
And the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

35
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:42,106
Yeah, a little spit and polish,

36
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,404
he can clean this up sell it next year.

37
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,711
Wonder how many times
we bought the same one?

38
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,804
Hey, come on, Barb,
church was this morning, huh?

39
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,078
Hey, I mean,
praying's for church, huh? Come on.

40
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,134
I haven't seen you
in church lately.

41
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,278
Well, there's not much
sense in my going to church.

42
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:41,548
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

43
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,557
It was from right over there.

44
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,566
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree

45
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,329
And grandpa got all excited, and
he shook his fist at me, and he said,

46
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,715
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell. "

47
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,561
Remember that?
Right over there.

48
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,403
Well, you used
to really be scared here.

49
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:58,376
Johnny.

50
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:02,268
- Well, you're still afraid.
- Stop it now. I mean it.

51
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:09,217
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

52
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,154
Stop it. You're ignorant.

53
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,450
They're coming for you, Barbra.

54
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,505
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,389
They're coming for you.

56
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,696
Look! There comes one of them now.

57
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,379
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes. I getting out of here.

58
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,636
Johnny!

59
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:39,607
Johnny!

60
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,449
Help me!
